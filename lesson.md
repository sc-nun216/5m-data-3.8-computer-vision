# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

We will be using the `dl` environment for this lesson.

### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we will be learning about Computer Vision (CV) and the Basics of Image Processing. We will learn about Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture and how to train them. We will also be utilising Transfer Learning and Pre-trained Models for image classification.

## Part 1 - Neural Network and Deep Learning

We will be using the `notebooks/computer_vision_lesson.ipynb` notebook throughout this lesson.

> 1. Activate the environement `conda activate dl`.
> 2. Run `jupyter notebook`.
> 3. In the notebook, open `notebooks/computer_vision_lesson.ipynb`.
> 4. Follow on with the lesson in the notebook.
